## Introduction

Welcome to the "Mathematical and Numerical Investigations of the Lugiato-Lefever Equation for Kerr Optical Frequency Combs" project! This README provides an overview of the project, details about the folder structure, prerequisites, installation instructions, usage guidelines for different methods and boundary conditions, features, how to contribute, licensing, and contact information.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the mathematical and numerical investigations of the Lugiato-Lefever equation for Kerr optical frequency combs. It utilizes MATLAB for implementing and studying various methods, including Finite Element and Finite Difference methods, under different boundary conditions.

## Folder Structure

The project is organized into the following folders:

- **FEM**: Finite Element Method with Neumann Boundary Condition (synchronized solution).
- **FEM_per**: Finite Element Method with Periodic Boundary Condition.
- **FDM**: Finite Difference Method with Neumann Boundary Condition (synchronized solution).
- **FDM_per**: Finite Difference Method with Periodic Boundary Condition.

Each folder contains MATLAB files, including "cdms_lle.m," to run simulations and investigate the Lugiato-Lefever equation under different conditions.
